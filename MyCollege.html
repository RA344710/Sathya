                  The team just recently won a large multi-million euro, multi-year digital transformation deal with a major British bank. The bank hired Wipro Digital to transform its value proposition, construct a comprehensive change portfolio and execute the necessary change.
                  Wipro Digital acquired Danish strategic design firm DesignIt in July 2015 and grew it from 300 to 420 employees – a very significant step, acknowledging that in digital transformation, “design is foundation, not decoration”.
                  The team’s compelling agile framework and 5-step methodology was proven in various large projects with corporate customers such as Telenor or Chelsea Football Club.
                  Wipro Digital has strongly enlarged its network of ‘digital pods’ (innovation & co-creation centers) across the globe.
